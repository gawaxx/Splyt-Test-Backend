# Splyt-Test-Backend

This is the Backend code challenge for Splyt. The two tasks can be found in their respective folders.

# How-to

First you need to make sure you have NodeJS installed

To run each tasks through the terminal, navigate inside the folder you want, and then run **node** ***filename***

Example: to run task1, **cd task1**, **node task1.js**

# Notes

For **Task1**, I think the solution relies on spliting given number and input number, whereas given numbers are a/b/c etc... and input numbers are A/B/C.
Therefore in that case, we can say that b > A, a > B, A > B, a > b, unless (a,b) or (A,B) is present. And it satisfies the functions. 

However, I was unsuccesful in completing all assertions, and while I think I was close to finding a solution, I could not. Therefore 2 out of 8 from the example given couldn't be completed.

As for **Task2**, it was challenging but I think I got there in the end. It worked for the different values I tested and follows what the README asked for.

You can enter the meeting duration as well as the schedules at the top. And then all you need to do is run the file.
