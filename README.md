# Splyt-Test-Backend

This is the Backend code challenge for Splyt. The two tasks can be found in their respective folders.

# How-to

First you need to make sure you have NodeJS installed

To run each tasks through the terminal, navigate inside the folder you want, and then run **node** ***filename***

Example: to run task1, **cd task1**, **node task1.js**

I think the solution relies on spliting given number and input number, whereas given numbers are a/b/c etc... and input numbers are A/B/C.
Therefore in that case, we can say that b > A, a > B, A > B, a > b. And it satisfies the functions.
